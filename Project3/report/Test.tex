\subsection*{Preface}
Below are the manual test ran on the program to test the validity of the peer to peer program. 

\subsection*{Tests}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Start client before server running.\\
\textbf{Expected}\\
Error - Index Server not bound. Please start index server before launching client\\
\textbf{Result}\\
Error - Index Server not bound. Please start index server before launching client\\
\textbf{Pass:} True\\

\item Start server and check if running.\\
\textbf{Expected}\\
Server is running.\\
To exit type 'exit'.\\
\textbf{Result}\\
Server is running.\\
To exit type 'exit'.\\
\textbf{Pass:} True\\

\item Start another instance of the server if one is already running\\
\textbf{Expected}\\
Error -Server is already bound.\\
\textbf{Result}\\
Error -Server is already bound.\\
\textbf{Pass:} True\\


\item Start client with no id as argument\\
\textbf{Expected}\\
Please enter a peer id as a command line argument\\
\textbf{Result}\\
Please enter a peer id as a command line argument\\
\textbf{Pass:} True\\


\item Start client with a unique id of 1 after server is running.\\
\textbf{Expected}\\
Client running... PeerID = 1\\
Options:\\
1 - Search for filename\\
2 - Obtain filename from peer\\
3 - List files in shared directory\\
4 - Update registry\\
5 - Exit\\
\textbf{Result}\\
Client running... PeerID = 1\\
Options:\\
1 - Search for filename\\
2 - Obtain filename from peer\\
3 - List files in shared directory\\
4 - Update registry\\
5 - Exit\\
\textbf{Pass:} True\\


\item Start another client with an id of 1 after another client of id 1 is running.\\
\textbf{Expected}\\
Error = Peer 1 is already bound. Please choose a different peer id or restart rmiregistry.\\
\textbf{Result}\\
Error = Peer 1 is already bound. Please choose a different peer id or restart rmiregistry.\\
\textbf{Pass:} True\\

\item Check that client registers file with server. Using files Text1.txt, Text2.txt, and Text2.txt in folder Client1. Only client 1 is running. Then run command 1 and search for Text1.txt, Text2.txt, Text3.txt, and Text4.txt. \\
\textbf{Expected}\\
For Text1.txt, Text2.txt and Text3.txt the result should be:\\
The clients that have the file Text\#.txt are:\\
Client 1\\
For Text4.txt the result should be:\\
There are no peers sharing Text4.txt.\\
\textbf{Result}\\
For Text1.txt, Text2.txt and Text3.txt the result should be:\\
The clients that have the file Text\#.txt are:\\
Client 1\\
For Text4.txt the result should be:\\
\textbf{Pass:} True\\

\item Check that if two clients have the same file that both show up. With client 1 running as in the above test case run client 2 with Text1.txt in the folder Client2. Then run the search command for Text1.txt \\
\textbf{Expected}\\
The clients that have the file Text1.txt are:\\
Client 1\\
Client 2\\
\textbf{Result}\\
The clients that have the file Text1.txt are:\\
Client 1\\
Client 2\\
\textbf{Pass:} True\\

\item Attempt to get a file that does not exist.\\
\textbf{Expected}\\
Enter filename: Text11.txt\\
Enter peer. If no preference enter 0.\\
0\\
The file Text11.txt does not exist.\\
\textbf{Result}\\
Enter filename: Text11.txt\\
Enter peer. If no preference enter 0.\\
0\\
The file Text11.txt does not exist.\\
\textbf{Pass:} True\\

\item Obtain file and check if exists. Client1 directory has Text1.txt and Client2 directory does not have Text1.txt. Then in client 2 run the command to get Text1.txt.\\
\textbf{Expected}\\
Enter filename: Text1.txt\\
Enter peer. If no preference enter 0.\\
0\\
Then Client2 directory has Text1.txt. \\
\textbf{Result}\\
Enter filename: Text1.txt\\
Enter peer. If no preference enter 0.\\
0\\
Then Client2 directory has Text1.txt. \\
\textbf{Pass:} True\\

\item Add new files to the shared directory for the client and run update registry command and check if registry is update. 
\textbf{Expected}\\
Run client. \\
Add new files to client.\\
Update registry\\
Search for file to see if the registry update.\\
\textbf{Result}\\
Run client. \\
Add new files to client.\\
Update registry\\
Search for file to see if the registry update.\\
\textbf{Pass:} True\\
